# GameFi Arcade: A Privacy-Focused Mini-Game Platform üéÆüîí

GameFi Arcade is an innovative GameFi platform where players can create FHE-encrypted mini-games. This platform is powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, enabling seamless privacy for creators and players alike. Whether you want to develop a puzzle game or a betting game, GameFi Arcade provides the tools to bring your ideas to life with an added layer of security.

## The Challenge: Privacy in Gaming

As gaming continues to evolve, users increasingly value their privacy. Traditional gaming platforms often expose players‚Äô data, leading to concerns over how it might be used or shared. This transparency can deter players from fully engaging in gaming experiences, particularly in genres like gambling or user-generated content (UGC). The challenge is to provide a gaming environment that encourages creativity while ensuring that sensitive player information remains confidential.

## The FHE Solution: Secure Game Development

Enter Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). By employing **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, GameFi Arcade allows developers to create mini-games that keep player data private. Players can enjoy game mechanics like betting and puzzles without worrying about their personal information being exposed. With FHE, data remains encrypted and secure even while being processed, setting a new standard for privacy in gaming.

## Core Features üåü

- **No-Code/Low-Code Game Editor**: Users can design their mini-games without needing extensive programming knowledge, simplifying the game creation process.
- **NFT Game Assets**: Every game created can be minted as an NFT, allowing creators to sell their games and assets on the platform.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Game earnings are split between creators and the platform, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.
- **User-Generated Content**: Encourage creativity and engagement by allowing players to create and submit their own games, enriching the platform's offerings.
- **Sandbox Experience**: Users can enjoy an arcade-style atmosphere where they can explore, play, and create in a welcome community space.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Zama FHE SDK**: The core component for implementing fully homomorphic encryption, ensuring data privacy throughout the game lifecycle.
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic and handling requests.
- **Hardhat**: For Ethereum development, including deployment and smart contract management.
- **React**: For building the front-end interface, making it interactive and user-friendly.
- **Solidity**: To develop smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. Download the project files (do not use `git clone`).
3. Navigate into the project directory.
4. Run the following command to install necessary dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Build & Run Guide üèóÔ∏è

To compile and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
3. Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
4. Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

You should now be able to access the GameFi Arcade platform in your browser and start creating or playing mini-games!

## Example Code Snippet üìù

Here‚Äôs an example of how you might define a simple mini-game smart contract using Solidity. This example includes private data handling:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "https://github.com/Zama-FHE/zama-fhe-sdk/...";
import "ERC721.sol"; // Assume you have ERC721 implementation for NFTs

contract GameFiArcade is ERC721 {
    struct Game {
        string title;
        string encryptedData;
        address creator;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Game) public games;

    function createGame(string memory title, string memory encryptedData) public {
        uint256 gameId = totalSupply() + 1;
        games[gameId] = Game(title, encryptedData, msg.sender);
        _mint(msg.sender, gameId);
    }
}
```

This simple contract allows creators to submit their games, securely storing their encrypted details while providing users with ownership through NFTs.
